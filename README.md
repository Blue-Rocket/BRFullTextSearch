# BRFullTextSearch

iOS Objective-C full text search engine.

This project provides a way to integrate full-text search capabilities into your iOS
project. First, it provides a protocol-based API for a simple text indexing and
search framework. Second, it provides a [CLucene](http://clucene.sourceforge.net/)
based implementation of that framework.

# Example Usage

The following snippet shows how the API works. The `CLuceneSearchService` reference
is the only CLucene-specific portion of the code:

```objc
id<BRSearchService> service = [[CLuceneSearchService alloc] initWithIndexPath:@"/some/path"];

// add a document to the index
id<BRIndexable> doc = [[BRSimpleIndexable alloc] initWithIdentifier:@"1" data:@{
					   kBRSearchFieldNameTitle : @"Special document",
					   kBRSearchFieldNameValue : @"This is a long winded note with really important details in it."
					   }];
NSError *error = nil;
[service addObjectToIndexAndWait:doc error:&error];

// search for documents and log contents of each result
id<BRSearchResults> results = [service search:@"special"];
[results iterateWithBlock:^(NSUInteger index, id<BRSearchResult>result, BOOL *stop) {
	NSLog(@"Found result: %@", [result dictionaryRepresentation]);
}];
```

# Core Data support

It's pretty easy to integrate BRFullTextSearch with Core Data, to maintain a search
index while changes are persisted in Core Data. One way is to listen for the
`NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification` notification and process Core Data
changes as index delete and update operations. The **SampleCoreDataProject** project
contains an example of this integration. The app allows you to create small _sticky
notes_ and search the text of those notes. See the
[CoreDataManager](https://github.com/Blue-Rocket/BRFullTextSearch/blob/master/SampleCoreDataProject/SampleCoreDataProject/CoreDataManager.m) class in the sample
project, whose `maintainSearchIndexFromManagedObjectDidSave:` method handles this.

# Project Integration

You can integrate BRFullTextSearch via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), or
manually as either a dependent project or static framework.

## via CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

```bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project, and create a file named `Podfile` with
contents similar to this:

	platform :ios, '5.0' 
	pod 'BRFullTextSearch', '~> 1.0'

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```
Open your project in Xcode using the **.xcworkspace** file CocoaPods generated.

**Note:** the `use_frameworks!` option is not supported, see #4. Any pull requests
to allow for building as a dynamic framework are very welcome!

## via static framework

Using this approach you'll build a static library framework that you can manually
integrate into your own project. After cloning the BRFullTextSearch repository,
first initialize git submodules. For example:

	git clone https://github.com/Blue-Rocket/BRFullTextSearch.git
	cd BRFullTextSearch
	git submodule update --init
	
This will pull in the relevant submodules, e.g. CLucene.

The BRFullTextSearch Xcode project includes a target called
**BRFullTextSearch.framework** that builds a static library framework. Build that
target, which will produce a `Framework/Release/BRFullTextSearch.framework` bundle at
the root project directory. Copy that framework into your project and add it as a
build dependency.

You must also add the following linker build dependencies, which you can do by
clicking the **+** button in the **Link Binary With Libraries** section of the
**Build Phases** tab in the project settings:

 * libz
 * libstdc++

Next, add `-ObjC` as an *Other Linker Flags* build setting. If you do not have any
C++ sources in your project, you probably also need to add `-stdlib=libstdc++` to
this setting as well.

Finally, you'll need to add the path to the directory containing the
`BRFullTextSearch.framework` bundle as a **Framework Search Paths** value in the
**Build Settings** tab of the project settings.

The **SampleStaticLibraryProject** included in this repository is an example project
set up using the static library framework integration approach. You must build
**BRFullTextSearch.framework** first, then open this project. When you run the
project, it will index a set of documents using some Latin text. You can then search
for latin words using a simple UI.

## via dependent project

Another way you can integrate BRFullTextSearch into your project is to add the
BRFullTextSearch Xcode project as a dependent project of your project. The
BRFullTextSearch Xcode project includes a target called **BRFullTextSearch** that
builds a static library. You can use that target as a dependency in your own project.

After cloning the BRFullTextSearch repository, first initialize git submodules. For
example:

	git clone https://github.com/Blue-Rocket/BRFullTextSearch.git
	cd BRFullTextSearch
	git submodule update --init
	
This will pull in the relevant submodules, e.g. CLucene.

Then drag the **BRFullTextSearch.xcodeproj** onto your project in the Project
Navigator. Then go to the **Build Phases** tab of your project's settings. Expand the
**Target Dependencies** section and click the **+** button. You should see the
**BRFullTextSearch** static library target as an available option. Select that and
click the **Add** button.

You must also add the following linker build dependencies, which you can do by
clicking the **+** button in the **Link Binary With Libraries** section of the
**Build Phases** tab in the project settings:

 * libz
 * libstdc++

Next, add `-ObjC` as an *Other Linker Flags* build setting.

Finally, you'll need to add the path to the directory containing the
*BRFullTextSearch.xcodeproj* file as a **Header Search Paths** value in the **Build
Settings** tab of the project settings. If you have added BRFullTextSearch as a git
submodule to your own project, then the path might be something like
**"$(PROJECT_DIR)/../BRFullTextSearch"**.
