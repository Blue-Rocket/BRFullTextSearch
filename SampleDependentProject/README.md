FullTextSearch - Sample Dependent Project
=========================================

This sample project shows how to integrate the `BRFullTextSearch`
framework into an application using a dependent Xcode project. This
project is configured to support iOS 5.1.1 in order to deploy onto
original iPad devices.

The app is a very basic example of indexing documents and searching the
index. A set of random-length latin text is indexed for a set of
documents when the app launches. You can then search for latin terms,
e.g. "lorem".
