FullTextSearch - Sample Static Library Project
==============================================

This sample project shows how to integrate the `BRFullTextSearch` static
framework into an application. This project is configured to support iOS
**5.1.1** in order to deploy onto original iPad devices. It does not
build a 64-bit architecture, so Xcode is still able to launch
**Release** builds on original iPad devices.

The app is a very basic example of indexing documents and searching the
index. A set of random-length latin text is indexed for a set of
documents when the app launches. You can then search for latin terms,
e.g. "lorem".
