# BRFullTextSearch OS X sample project

This project is a sample OS X application that integrates `BRFullTextSearch` via CooaPods. It allows adding small text "notes" which are stored in Core Data. The search index is maintained by responding to changes in Core Data.

# Usage

The app will start off with a few sample notes, shown in a table.
