/**
  An <code>IndexWriter</code> creates and maintains an index.

  <p>The <code>create</code> argument to the
  <a href="#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory, org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer, boolean)"><b>constructor</b></a>
  determines whether a new index is created, or whether an existing index is
  opened.  Note that you
  can open an index with <code>create=true</code> even while readers are
  using the index.  The old readers will continue to search
  the "point in time" snapshot they had opened, and won't
  see the newly created index until they re-open.  There are
  also <a href="#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory, org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer)"><b>constructors</b></a>
  with no <code>create</code> argument which
  will create a new index if there is not already an index at the
  provided path and otherwise open the existing index.</p>

  <p>In either case, documents are added with <a
  href="#addDocument(org.apache.lucene.document.Document)"><b>addDocument</b></a>
  and removed with <a
  href="#deleteDocuments(org.apache.lucene.index.Term)"><b>deleteDocuments</b></a>.
  A document can be updated with <a href="#updateDocument(org.apache.lucene.index.Term, org.apache.lucene.document.Document)"><b>updateDocument</b></a>
  (which just deletes and then adds the entire document).
  When finished adding, deleting and updating documents, <a href="#close()"><b>close</b></a> should be called.</p>

  <p>These changes are buffered in memory and periodically
  flushed to the {@link Directory} (during the above method
  calls).  A flush is triggered when there are enough
  buffered deletes (see {@link #setMaxBufferedDeleteTerms})
  or enough added documents since the last flush, whichever
  is sooner.  For the added documents, flushing is triggered
  either by RAM usage of the documents (see {@link
  #setRAMBufferSizeMB}) or the number of added documents.
  The default is to flush when RAM usage hits 16 MB.  For
  best indexing speed you should flush by RAM usage with a
  large RAM buffer.  You can also force a flush by calling
  {@link #flush}.  When a flush occurs, both pending deletes
  and added documents are flushed to the index.  A flush may
  also trigger one or more segment merges which by default
  run with a background thread so as not to block the
  addDocument calls (see <a href="#mergePolicy">below</a>
  for changing the {@link MergeScheduler}).</p>

  <a name="autoCommit"></a>
  <p>The optional <code>autoCommit</code> argument to the
  <a href="#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory, boolean, org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer)"><b>constructors</b></a>
  controls visibility of the changes to {@link IndexReader} instances reading the same index.
  When this is <code>false</code>, changes are not
  visible until {@link #close()} is called.
  Note that changes will still be flushed to the
  {@link org.apache.lucene.store.Directory} as new files,
  but are not committed (no new <code>segments_N</code> file
  is written referencing the new files) until {@link #close} is
  called.  If something goes terribly wrong (for example the
  JVM crashes) before {@link #close()}, then
  the index will reflect none of the changes made (it will
  remain in its starting state).
  You can also call {@link #abort()}, which closes the writer without committing any
  changes, and removes any index
  files that had been flushed but are now unreferenced.
  This mode is useful for preventing readers from refreshing
  at a bad time (for example after you've done all your
  deletes but before you've done your adds).
  It can also be used to implement simple single-writer
  transactional semantics ("all or none").</p>

  <p>When <code>autoCommit</code> is <code>true</code> then
  every flush is also a commit ({@link IndexReader}
  instances will see each flush as changes to the index).
  This is the default, to match the behavior before 2.2.
  When running in this mode, be careful not to refresh your
  readers while optimize or segment merges are taking place
  as this can tie up substantial disk space.</p>

  <p>Regardless of <code>autoCommit</code>, an {@link
  IndexReader} or {@link org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher} will only see the
  index as of the "point in time" that it was opened.  Any
  changes committed to the index after the reader was opened
  are not visible until the reader is re-opened.</p>

  <p>If an index will not have more documents added for a while and optimal search
  performance is desired, then the <a href="#optimize()"><b>optimize</b></a>
  method should be called before the index is closed.</p>

  <p>Opening an <code>IndexWriter</code> creates a lock file for the directory in use. Trying to open
  another <code>IndexWriter</code> on the same directory will lead to a
  {@link LockObtainFailedException}. The {@link LockObtainFailedException}
  is also thrown if an IndexReader on the same directory is used to delete documents
  from the index.</p>

  <a name="deletionPolicy"></a>
  <p>Expert: <code>IndexWriter</code> allows an optional
  {@link IndexDeletionPolicy} implementation to be
  specified.  You can use this to control when prior commits
  are deleted from the index.  The default policy is {@link
  KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy} which removes all prior
  commits as soon as a new commit is done (this matches
  behavior before 2.2).  Creating your own policy can allow
  you to explicitly keep previous "point in time" commits
  alive in the index for some time, to allow readers to
  refresh to the new commit without having the old commit
  deleted out from under them.  This is necessary on
  filesystems like NFS that do not support "delete on last
  close" semantics, which Lucene's "point in time" search
  normally relies on. </p>

  <a name="mergePolicy"></a> <p>Expert:
  <code>IndexWriter</code> allows you to separately change
  the {@link MergePolicy} and the {@link MergeScheduler}.
  The {@link MergePolicy} is invoked whenever there are
  changes to the segments in the index.  Its role is to
  select which merges to do, if any, and return a {@link
  MergePolicy.MergeSpecification} describing the merges.  It
  also selects merges to do for optimize().  (The default is
  {@link LogByteSizeMergePolicy}.  Then, the {@link
  MergeScheduler} is invoked with the requested merges and
  it decides when and how to run the merges.  The default is
  {@link ConcurrentMergeScheduler}. </p>
 */
/*
 * Clarification: Check Points (and commits)
 * Being able to set autoCommit=false allows IndexWriter to flush and
 * write new index files to the directory without writing a new segments_N
 * file which references these new files. It also means that the state of
 * the in memory SegmentInfos object is different than the most recent
 * segments_N file written to the directory.
 *
 * Each time the SegmentInfos is changed, and matches the (possibly
 * modified) directory files, we have a new "check point".
 * If the modified/new SegmentInfos is written to disk - as a new
 * (generation of) segments_N file - this check point is also an
 * IndexCommitPoint.
 *
 * With autoCommit=true, every checkPoint is also a CommitPoint.
 * With autoCommit=false, some checkPoints may not be commits.
 *
 * A new checkpoint always replaces the previous checkpoint and
 * becomes the new "front" of the index. This allows the IndexFileDeleter
 * to delete files that are referenced only by stale checkpoints.
 * (files that were created since the last commit, but are no longer
 * referenced by the "front" of the index). For this, IndexFileDeleter
 * keeps track of the last non commit checkpoint.

   *
   * <p>It is recommended that this method be called upon completion of indexing.  In

   * </p>
   * <p>See http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/47895 for more discussion. </p>
   *
   * <p>Note that this can require substantial temporary free
   * space in the Directory (see <a target="_top"
   * href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-764">LUCENE-764</a>
   * for details):</p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>
   *
   * <p>If no readers/searchers are open against the index,
   * then free space required is up to 1X the total size of
   * the starting index.  For example, if the starting
   * index is 10 GB, then you must have up to 10 GB of free
   * space before calling optimize.</p>
   *
   * <li>
   *
   * <p>If readers/searchers are using the index, then free
   * space required is up to 2X the size of the starting
   * index.  This is because in addition to the 1X used by
   * optimize, the original 1X of the starting index is
   * still consuming space in the Directory as the readers
   * are holding the segments files open.  Even on Unix,
   * where it will appear as if the files are gone ("ls"
   * won't list them), they still consume storage due to
   * "delete on last close" semantics.</p>
   *
   * <p>Furthermore, if some but not all readers re-open
   * while the optimize is underway, this will cause > 2X
   * temporary space to be consumed as those new readers
   * will then hold open the partially optimized segments at
   * that time.  It is best not to re-open readers while
   * optimize is running.</p>
   *
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>The actual temporary usage could be much less than
   * these figures (it depends on many factors).</p>
   *
   * <p>In general, once the optimize completes, the total size of the
   * index will be less than the size of the starting index.
   * It could be quite a bit smaller (if there were many
   * pending deletes) or just slightly smaller.</p>
   *
   * <p>If an Exception is hit during optimize(), for example
   * due to disk full, the index will not be corrupt and no
   * documents will have been lost.  However, it may have
   * been partially optimized (some segments were merged but
   * not all), and it's possible that one of the segments in
   * the index will be in non-compound format even when

   * newly created segments will not be optimized unless you
   * call optimize again.</p>
