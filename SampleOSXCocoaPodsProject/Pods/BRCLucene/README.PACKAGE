CLucene is a C++ port of the popular Apache Lucene search engine
(http://lucene.apache.org/java). It is released under LGPL or the Apache
License.

CLucene aims to be a high-speed alternative to Java Lucene, its API is very
similar to that of the Java version. CLucene has recently been brought up to
date with Lucene 2.3.2. It contains most of the same functionality as the
Java version.

This package contains the files necessary for running applications that
use the libclucene library.
