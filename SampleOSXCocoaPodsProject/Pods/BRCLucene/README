Documentation
-------------
You can build your own documentation by running 'make DoxygenDoc' from your 
'out-of-source' cmake-configured build directory.
CLucene is a very close port of Java Lucene, so you can also try looking at the
Java Docs on http://lucene.apache.org/java/
There is an online version (which won't be as up to date as if you build your
own) at http://clucene.sourceforge.net/doc/html/
